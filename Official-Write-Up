If you want to start task, you need to contact with bot (In my case : @deep_learing_bot);

First part:

Now we cant really understand, what we need to do.
Lets use command : /commands to see the list of all our opportunities.
Only thing we can do: /help. That's all :)

After using command help we can see:
The scouts conveyed the message, but it seems that it is a little distorted: 
Itâ€™s not enough to think like a RmxhZw==, you need to 6265636f6d65 a RmxhZw==.
To check state : /state

There is not very hard crypt so we can easily decrypt it:
   RmxhZw== is b64. With decryption: Flag
   6265636f6d65 is HEX. With decryption: become

Second part:

After changing telegram nickname to something with Flag (not flag or another variants) :
We are getting .rar file that contains a lot of folders inside.
After walking through with python script using os library you could find 2 .txt files inside in which state:
   maybe these files contain the anzr bs fbzr shapgvba?

anzr bs fbzr shapgvba? - Simple caesars; 
On ROT13 can find : name of some function?

Second file:
   Every clue could be
   Very sad, but useful
   And the only thing that you can do
   Let yourself to write answers to the bot
   ()

Nothing interesning here? Not really:
   E  very clue could be
   V  ery sad, but useful
   A  nd the only thing that you can do
   L  et yourself to write answers to the bot
   ()

That's how we can find the name of the function.

Send it to bot:
   eval();

Third part:

Bot will answer:

@bot.message_handler(content_types=['text'])
            def flag(message):
                message.text = filtr(message)
                (eval(message.text))
                # To the developer:
                # Do not forget to change variable 'flag' to function!
                # And bot name from 'bot' to something another!


references to the use of a specific library:
   @bot.message_handler(content_types=['text'])

Hint could be in commentaries:
   Do not forget to change variable 'flag' to function!
So now you know that FLAG is variable, not function or something.

Second comment:
   And bot name from 'bot' to something another!
So now you know bot name = bot;

Now you need to send message from bot to yourself using eval() function and telebot methods like this:
   bot.send_message(message.chat.id, flag) or 
   bot.send_message(chat_id = message.chat.id, text = flag)

Final steps:

We are gettin string in this format:
   VzBXX1kwVV80UjNfUjM0TExZXzZSMzRUX0g0Q3w8M1I=
Classic b64 encryption;
After decryption:
   RFlag{W0W_Y0U_4R3_R34LLY_6R34T_H4C|<3R}
Let bot eat this flag and congrats:
Congtats! Thanks for doing this task!
